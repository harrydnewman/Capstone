# To Do

- Set up python backend server - done
- Figure out if I want a DB/How to set that up
- Redo frontend:
  - Need to continue with how AI sees u section
    - Need to format the data
      - Figure out what the output is of each model
        - Then find/make PNGs for each output (ie cigarette for smoker, cigarette with x for non smoker)
        - For now just change the text output, like if output == "sad", make it == Sad
    - Need to do next section once this is all done
      - Come back to online page later, just keep going for now
    - Change animation color from black to white
    - Use real data instead of sample data
    - STATISTICS PAGE!!!
Backend:
- delete image once its done
