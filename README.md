# The Bias Effect

The Bias Effect is an interactive web project that confronts users with the unsettling realities of facial recognition AI. By uploading a single image, users receive a series of trait classifications: race, age, attractiveness, emotion, and more. The experience is designed to be personal, invasive, and emotionally provocative, showing how algorithmic identity can be constructed from a single image.
